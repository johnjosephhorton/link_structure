# Link Structure Exercise - Teaching Notes

I have students create web pages for products in the Northwind database.
This is a good way to have them learn basics of HTML and CSS.
I have them do this with repl.it, which gives each page a public URL.
I then have them create a ``Pairings`` section where they link to their classmates products.
From this, I can then extract the link structure, which in turn I can use to each PageRank, TF-IDF etc.
